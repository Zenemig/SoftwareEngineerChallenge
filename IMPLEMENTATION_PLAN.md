- ✅ Replace existing `page.tsx` with setup gallery implementation
- ✅ Import tRPC server-side calling pattern using `prefetch(trpc.setup.all.queryOptions())`
- ✅ Set up proper page layout and container structure
- ✅ Implement server-side data fetching foundation

#### Task 1.2: Create Submission Page Route ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Create `apps/nextjs/src/app/submit/page.tsx`
- ✅ Set up basic page structure and form layout
- ✅ Implement navigation between pages
- ✅ Create centralized navigation component

#### Task 1.3: Add Required UI Components ✅ **COMPLETED**

```bash
cd packages/ui && pnpm ui-add card    # ✅ COMPLETED
cd packages/ui && pnpm ui-add badge   # ✅ COMPLETED
```

- ✅ Add Card component for setup display
- ✅ Add Badge component for tags (data available in mock data)
- ✅ Verify existing components (Button, Input, Label, Form)
- ✅ Create reusable Navigation component integrated into root layout

### Phase 2: Gallery Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED** (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Implement the core gallery functionality with server-side data fetching

#### Task 2.1: Setup Gallery Server Component ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Implement tRPC server-side calling pattern: `appRouter.createCaller(ctx).setup.all()`
- ✅ Create responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- ✅ Ensure proper TypeScript typing for setup data with `RouterOutputs` type
- ✅ Create custom `getSetups()` function for centralized data fetching logic
- ✅ Implement proper error handling with try-catch and user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Optimize code structure by extracting `GalleryLayout` component to eliminate duplication

#### Task 2.2: Create Setup Card Component ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Design attractive card layout with image, title, author, description, and tags
- ✅ Implement responsive design with proper flexbox layout for consistent card heights
- ✅ Add proper image optimization with Next.js Image component and error handling
- ✅ Include description text with proper spacing and text truncation
- ✅ Display tags using optimized styling with proper positioning at bottom of cards
- ✅ Implement hybrid Server/Client component architecture for optimal performance
- ✅ Create reusable `ImageWithFallback` component for graceful image error handling
- ✅ Enhance UI consistency using proper Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter, and Badge components
- ✅ Note: Tags and description are not required for submission form, only display
- ✅ **Performance Enhancement**: Implement LCP image priority for above-the-fold images to resolve Next.js performance warnings
- ✅ **Enhancement Note**: While out of scope for this task, implementing full-screen image viewing would significantly improve user experience since viewing setup images is the main purpose of the application

**Task 2.2 Technical Implementation Details:**

**Component Architecture:**

- **SetupCard**: Server Component (no "use client") for optimal performance and SEO
- **ImageWithFallback**: Client Component handling image loading states and error fallbacks
- **Hybrid Approach**: Server renders content, client handles only image interactions

**Performance Optimization - LCP Image Priority:**

- **Problem Identified**: Next.js LCP warning for above-the-fold images affecting Core Web Vitals
- **Solution Implemented**: Priority loading for first 4 images (most likely above the fold)
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `priority?: boolean` prop to `ImageWithFallback` component
  - Updated `SetupCard` to accept and pass priority prop
  - Gallery page passes `priority={index < 4}` to prioritize first 4 images
- **Performance Impact**: Improves LCP metric without over-prioritizing all images
- **Responsive Consideration**: Covers first 4 rows on mobile, first row on desktop

**Layout & Styling:**

- **Flexbox Layout**: `flex h-full flex-col` ensures consistent card heights across grid
- **Tag Positioning**: `mt-auto` pushes tags to bottom regardless of description length
- **Responsive Grid**: `grid-rows-[auto]` enables proper height inheritance for flexbox
- **Image Overlay**: Like count positioned absolutely in top-right corner of images

**Image Handling:**

- **Next.js Image**: Optimized image loading with `fill` and responsive `sizes`
- **Error Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation with desktop icon and "Image unavailable" text
- **External Domains**: Configured `next.config.js` for Unsplash image hosting

**Code Quality:**

- **Component Reusability**: ImageWithFallback can be used across other components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance with proper interface definitions
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering for static content, minimal client JavaScript
- **Design System Integration**: Proper use of Card and Badge components for consistent UI
- **Maintainability**: Replaced custom styling with design system components

#### Task 2.3: Implement Like Button (Client Component) ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Add animated counter updates with slide-in effects
- ✅ Integrate tooltip system for user guidance and accessibility

**Technical Requirements:**

- ✅ Server Component for data fetching
- ✅ Client Component for interactive elements
- ✅ Type-safe tRPC integration
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)

**Task 2.3 Technical Implementation Details:**

- **LikeButton Component**: Client component with useState for like count and liked state
- **Animation System**: Smooth opacity transitions between heart icon states using overlapping icons
- **Counter Animation**: Key-based re-rendering with slide-in effects for number changes
- **Tooltip Integration**: Radix UI tooltip system with global provider in layout
- **State Management**: Local state for immediate user feedback without backend persistence
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Phase 3: Submission Form Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED** (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Build complete form submission with validation

#### Task 3.1: Create Zod Validation Schema ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Define shared validation schema in `packages/validators`
- ✅ **Required fields only**: title (string, required), author (string, required), imageUrl (URL, required)
- ✅ **Note**: No tags or description in submission form per README requirements
- ✅ Export schema for reuse between client and server

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `setupSubmissionSchema` in `packages/validators/src/index.ts`
- Schema validates: title (min length 1), author (min length 1), imageUrl (valid URL)
- Exported `SetupSubmission` TypeScript type for type safety
- Added `validateSetupSubmission` helper function with safe parse
- All TypeScript compilation, linting, and workspace typecheck passed successfully
- Schema ready for import in both Next.js app and API package

#### Task 3.2: Implement Server Action ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Create Server Action in `apps/nextjs/src/app/submit/actions.ts`
- ✅ Implement FormData validation using Zod schema
- ✅ Return proper error responses for validation failures
- ✅ Log successful submissions to console

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `submitSetup` Server Action in `apps/nextjs/src/app/submit/actions.ts`
- Uses `"use server"` directive for Next.js Server Actions
- Imports and uses our `setupSubmissionSchema` from `@acme/validators`
- Validates FormData for title, author, and imageUrl fields
- Returns structured response with success status, data, or field-specific errors
- Includes comprehensive error handling for validation failures and unexpected errors
- Logs successful submissions to console as required by README
- All TypeScript compilation, linting, and build checks passed successfully

#### Task 3.3: Build Submission Form Component ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Create form using shadcn/ui Form components

- Integrated with our `setupSubmissionSchema` from `@acme/validators` for client-side validation
- Uses react-hook-form with Zod schema integration for seamless validation
- Implements proper error handling with field-specific error display
- Includes loading states during submission with disabled submit button
- **Enhanced UX**: Integrated existing Toast system for success/error notifications
- **Professional Feedback**: Replaced custom messages with modern toast notifications
- **Theme Integration**: Toast automatically adapts to light/dark themes
- Automatically resets form on successful submission
- Handles server validation errors and displays them inline
- All TypeScript compilation, linting, and build checks passed successfully

**Technical Requirements:**

- Next.js Server Actions
- Zod validation on server-side
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Form accessibility and usability

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Improve user experience and implement advanced features

#### Task 4.1: UI/UX Improvements

**Objective**: Enhance user experience through improved loading states, error handling, responsive design, and smooth animations

**Implementation Strategy**: Implement these improvements systematically to create a polished, professional user experience that demonstrates attention to detail and modern web development practices.

##### 4.1.1: Loading States and Skeletons ✅ **COMPLETED**

**What**: Implement loading states **ONLY where they make architectural sense** and provide genuine user value for actual asynchronous operations.

**Why**: Loading states should only be added for operations that users experience as delays, not for server-side operations that are instant. This prevents over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.

**Where**: **ONLY** for client-side operations that have actual loading time, not for server-side data that's immediately available.

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Form Submission Loading State** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**:

   - **Status**: Complete - form already has `isSubmitting` state
   - **Features**: Submit button disabled, loading text, form fields disabled
   - **No changes needed** - this was correctly implemented

2. **Image Loading States** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**:

   - **Status**: Complete - `ImageWithFallback` already handles errors gracefully
   - **Features**: Error fallbacks, graceful degradation with desktop icon
   - **No changes needed** - Next.js Image + error fallback is sufficient

3. **Gallery Loading State** ❌ **UNNECESSARY OVER-ENGINEERING**:

   - **Status**: **REMOVE FROM PLAN** - Server component renders with data immediately
   - **Reason**: Server-side data fetching means no loading time for users
   - **Result**: Skeleton would show for 0ms - pointless visual noise

4. **Setup Card Loading State** ❌ **UNNECESSARY OVER-ENGINEERING**:

   - **Status**: **REMOVE FROM PLAN** - Cards receive data as props, no async loading
   - **Reason**: Data is already available when component renders
   - **Result**: Skeleton would never be visible - waste of development time

**Why This Analysis Matters**:

1. **Server Components Don't Need Loading States**: Data is fetched server-side and available immediately
2. **Client Components Only Need Loading States for Async Operations**: Like form submissions, API calls, etc.
3. **Over-engineering Loading States**: Creates unnecessary complexity and visual noise
4. **Performance Impact**: Unnecessary skeleton components add to bundle size and render complexity

**Corrected Implementation Plan**:

**What We Should Actually Implement**:

1. **Enhanced Form Loading States** (already done):

   - ✅ Submit button disabled state
   - ✅ Loading text during submission
   - ✅ Form field disabled during submission

2. **Image Loading Enhancements** (already done):

   - ✅ Error fallbacks for broken images
   - ✅ Graceful degradation with desktop icon

3. **Remove Unnecessary Loading States**:
   - ❌ Gallery skeleton (server component)
   - ❌ Card skeleton (data already available)
   - ❌ Any other server-side loading states

**Result**: Cleaner, more focused implementation that doesn't over-engineer solutions for problems that don't exist. Our current implementation is actually **more correct** than adding unnecessary loading states.

##### 4.1.2: Error Boundaries Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**What**: Keep current error handling as-is - it's already optimal for user experience.

**Why**: Our current error handling is simple, effective, and provides exactly what users need without unnecessary complexity or technical details they can't act upon.

**Where**: Current implementation in gallery page and submit form is already optimal.

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Gallery Error Handling** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMAL**:

   - **Status**: Complete - current implementation is simple and effective
   - **Features**: Clear error message: "Error loading setups: {error}"
   - **User Action**: Simple instruction to refresh the page
   - **No changes needed** - this provides the right user experience

2. **Form Error Handling** ✅ **ALREADY EXCELLENT**:

   - **Status**: Complete - form already has comprehensive error handling with toast integration
   - **Features**: Server validation errors, network errors, field-specific error display
   - **No changes needed** - this implementation is already production-ready

3. **Why No Changes Are Needed** ✅ **USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS**:

   - **User Can't Act on Technical Details**: "Database error" vs "Server error" - user can't fix either
   - **User Actions Are Limited**: Can refresh page, can't fix server issues
   - **Current Approach is Optimal**: Simple, clear, actionable without information overload
   - **Less is More**: Adding complexity would make UX worse, not better

**Current Implementation Analysis**:

```typescript
// Current approach - SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE
if (error) {
  return (
    <GalleryLayout>
      <div className="text-center text-red-500">
        <p className="text-lg">Error loading setups: {error}</p>
      </div>
    </GalleryLayout>
  );
}
```

**Why This is Already Optimal**:

1. **Clear User Communication**: User knows something went wrong
2. **Simple Action**: User knows to refresh and try again
3. **No Information Overload**: No unnecessary technical details
4. **Maintainable Code**: Simple, bug-free implementation
5. **Follows UX Best Practices**: "Less is more" principle

**Why Error Categorization Hurts UX**:

1. **Information Overload**: Technical jargon users don't understand
2. **False Sense of Control**: User thinks they need to understand error types
3. **Maintenance Burden**: More complex code, more potential bugs
4. **No User Benefit**: User actions remain the same regardless of error type

**Corrected Implementation Plan**:

**What We Should Actually Implement**:

1. **Keep Current Error Handling** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMAL**:

   - Simple error message: "Error loading setups: {error}"
   - No unnecessary categorization
   - No retry buttons (server component constraint)
   - Clear user action: refresh the page

2. **Remove Over-Engineering** ❌ **NOT NEEDED**:
   - No error categorization
   - No complex error messages
   - No retry functionality
   - No "enhanced" error handling

**What to Avoid**:

- Error categorization (user can't act on it)
- Complex error messages (information overload)
- Retry buttons (architectural mismatch)
- Over-engineering solutions for non-existent problems

**Result**: Keep the current simple, effective error handling that already provides the right user experience without unnecessary complexity.

**Key Insight**: Sometimes the best UX improvement is to NOT change what's already working well. Our current error handling is simple, clear, and gives users exactly what they need: knowledge that something went wrong and the simple action they can take (refresh the page).

##### 4.1.3: Enhanced Responsive Design ✅ **COMPLETED**

**What**: Fix the single responsive issue in navigation while keeping the excellent responsive design already implemented.

**Why**: Our current responsive design is already optimal for most components. Only the navigation needs a simple fix for very small screens (under 425px).

**Where**: Navigation component only - all other components are already properly responsive.

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Navigation Responsive Fix** ✅ **SINGLE ISSUE**:

   - **Problem**: Under 425px, navigation elements don't have enough space
   - **Solution**: Stack navigation elements vertically on very small screens
   - **Implementation**: Simple flexbox change from horizontal to vertical stacking
   - **Priority**: High - this is the only actual responsive issue

2. **Gallery Grid Responsiveness** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMAL**:

   - **Status**: Complete - responsive grid with proper breakpoints
   - **Features**: 1 col (mobile), 2 cols (tablet), 3 cols (laptop), 4 cols (desktop)
   - **No changes needed** - already follows responsive best practices

3. **Setup Card Responsiveness** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMAL**:

   - **Status**: Complete - responsive image handling and layout
   - **Features**: Proper aspect ratios, responsive grid integration
   - **No changes needed** - already mobile-optimized

4. **Form Responsiveness** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMAL**:

   - **Status**: Complete - responsive width constraints and spacing
   - **Features**: Mobile-friendly layout, proper input sizing
   - **No changes needed** - already follows responsive best practices

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Simple responsive navigation fix - stack vertically on small screens
<nav className="border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-background/60">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-4">
    {/* Stack vertically on very small screens */}
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between">
      <Link href="/" className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">
        Rate My Setup
      </Link>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
        <Link href="/">
          <Button variant="ghost">Gallery</Button>
        </Link>
        <Link href="/submit">
          <Button>Submit Setup</Button>
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```

**Why This Approach is Better**:

1. **Focused on Real Problems**: Only fixes the one actual responsive issue
2. **No Over-Engineering**: Keeps existing excellent responsive design
3. **Simple Solution**: Single flexbox change, no complex components needed
4. **Maintains UX**: Navigation remains accessible and functional on all screen sizes

**What We DON'T Need (Over-Engineering)**:

1. **Mobile Menu/Hamburger**:

   - **Why not needed**: Only 3 navigation elements, no need for complex menu
   - **Result**: Unnecessary complexity for simple navigation

2. **Responsive Typography Changes**:

   - **Why not needed**: Current typography already scales appropriately
   - **Result**: No user benefit, just more code

3. **Complex Breakpoint Adjustments**:

   - **Why not needed**: Only one component has responsive issues
   - **Result**: Over-engineering for single problem

4. **Touch Target Optimization**:
   - **Why not needed**: Current buttons are already properly sized
   - **Result**: No actual improvement needed

**Result**: Focused fix for the only actual responsive issue while keeping the excellent responsive design that's already implemented across all other components.

##### 4.1.4: Smooth Transitions and Animations

**What**: Implement subtle, performant animations that enhance user interactions without being distracting or causing performance issues.

**Why**: Smooth animations improve perceived performance, provide visual feedback for user actions, and create a more polished, professional application feel.

**Where**: Apply to page transitions, card interactions, form submissions, and loading states throughout the application.

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Page Transition Animations**:

   - Implement smooth fade-in effects for page content
   - Add subtle slide animations for navigation between pages
   - Use CSS transitions for smooth state changes

2. **Card Interaction Animations**:

   - Hover effects with subtle shadow and scale changes
   - Smooth transitions for like button state changes
   - Image hover effects with subtle zoom or overlay changes

3. **Form Animation Enhancements**:

   - Smooth form field focus states
   - Animated error message appearances
   - Loading state transitions with spinners and progress indicators

4. **Loading State Animations**:
   - Skeleton loading with pulse animations
   - Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
   - Progressive loading indicators for better user feedback

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Enhanced card animations
<Card className="overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1">
  {/* Card content */}
</Card>

// Smooth like button transitions
<Button
  onClick={handleLike}
  variant={isLiked ? "default" : "outline"}
  className="transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out hover:scale-105 active:scale-95"
>
  <Heart className={`w-4 h-4 mr-2 transition-all duration-200 ${
    isLiked ? 'text-red-500 scale-110' : 'text-muted-foreground'
  }`} />
  {likes} likes
</Button>

// Form field focus animations
<Input
  className="transition-all duration-200 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:border-primary"
  {...field}
/>
```

**Performance Considerations**:

- Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Implement `will-change` CSS property for elements that will animate
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for complex JavaScript animations
- Ensure animations don't block the main thread
- Test animations on lower-end devices to ensure smooth performance

**Accessibility Enhancements**:

- Respect user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Provide alternative interaction methods for users with motion sensitivity
- Maintain proper focus management during animated transitions

#### Task 4.2: Navigation & Layout

- Add navigation header with links between pages
- Implement consistent page layout
- Add proper page titles and metadata

#### Task 4.3: Advanced Challenge Selection

Choose one advanced challenge to implement:

- **Option A**: Optimistic UI with `useOptimistic` hook
- **Option B**: Shared validation schema between client/server
- **Option C**: Advanced component patterns (Compound Components)

### Phase 5: Documentation & Quality Assurance (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Ensure deliverable quality and documentation

#### Task 5.1: Update DESIGN_CHOICES.md

- Document implementation decisions and trade-offs
- Explain architecture choices and patterns used
- Add challenges faced and lessons learned
- Include future improvement suggestions

#### Task 5.2: Code Quality Review

- Run linting and fix any issues
- Ensure TypeScript compilation without errors
- Test all functionality manually
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

  };
}

export function SetupCard({ setup }: SetupCardProps) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(setup.likes);
  const [isLiked, setIsLiked] = useState(false);

  const handleLike = () => {
    setLikes(prev => isLiked ? prev - 1 : prev + 1);
    setIsLiked(prev => !prev);
  };

  return (
    <Card className="overflow-hidden">
      <div className="aspect-video relative">
        <Image
          src={setup.imageUrl}
          alt={setup.title}

          ❤️ {likes} likes
        </Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Validation Schema Design

```typescript
// packages/validators/src/setup.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const submitSetupSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, "Title is required").max(100, "Title too long"),
  author: z
    .string()
    .min(1, "Author is required")
    .max(50, "Author name too long"),
  imageUrl: z.string().url("Must be a valid URL"),
});

export type SubmitSetupInput = z.infer<typeof submitSetupSchema>;
```

### Server Action Implementation

```typescript
// apps/nextjs/src/app/submit/actions.ts
"use server";

## 4. Advanced Challenge Implementation Options

### Option A: Optimistic UI with useOptimistic

```typescript
"use client";

import { useOptimistic } from "react";

export function SetupCard({ setup }: SetupCardProps) {
  const [optimisticLikes, addOptimisticLike] = useOptimistic(
    setup.likes,
    (currentLikes, increment: number) => currentLikes + increment,
  );

  const handleLike = () => {
    const increment = isLiked ? -1 : 1;
    addOptimisticLike(increment);
    setIsLiked((prev) => !prev);
  };

  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Option B: Shared Validation Schema

```typescript
// Client-side validation with react-hook-form
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

import { submitSetupSchema } from "@acme/validators/setup";

export function SubmissionForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(submitSetupSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      title: "",
      author: "",
      imageUrl: "",
    },
  });

  // ... form implementation
}
```

### Option C: Compound Components Pattern

```typescript
// Flexible Setup Card with compound components
export const SetupCard = {
  Root: SetupCardRoot,
  Image: SetupCardImage,
  Content: SetupCardContent,
  Header: SetupCardHeader,
  Description: SetupCardDescription,
  Tags: SetupCardTags,
  LikeButton: SetupCardLikeButton,
};

// Usage
<SetupCard.Root>
  <SetupCard.Image src={setup.imageUrl} alt={setup.title} />
  <SetupCard.Content>
    <SetupCard.Header title={setup.title} author={setup.author} />
    <SetupCard.Description>{setup.description}</SetupCard.Description>
    <SetupCard.Tags tags={setup.tags} />
    <SetupCard.LikeButton initialLikes={setup.likes} />
  </SetupCard.Content>
</SetupCard.Root>
```

## 5. Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Gallery Page Testing

- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All 12 setups display correctly
- [ ] Images load and display properly
- [ ] Responsive layout works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Like buttons increment/decrement correctly
- [ ] Like state persists during page interaction

#### Submission Page Testing

- [ ] Form displays all required fields
- [ ] Client-side validation works (if implemented)
- [ ] Server-side validation errors display correctly
- [ ] Successful submission shows confirmation
- [ ] Form resets after successful submission
- [ ] Navigation between pages works

#### Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome (primary development browser)
- [ ] Safari (mobile testing)
- [ ] Firefox (alternative testing)

### Performance Considerations

#### Image Optimization

- Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- Implement lazy loading for gallery images
- Consider blur placeholders for better UX

#### Bundle Size Management

- Use dynamic imports for heavy components if needed
- Ensure tRPC client-side bundle is optimized
- Monitor bundle analyzer output

## 6. Risk Management & Contingency Plans

### Time Management Risks

#### Risk: Feature Implementation Takes Longer Than Expected

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- Prioritize core features (gallery + basic like functionality)
- Implement submission form as MVP without advanced validation
- Skip advanced challenges if time is short
- Focus on working functionality over polish

#### Risk: tRPC Integration Issues

**Contingency Plan:**

- Fall back to direct API routes if tRPC server-side calling is problematic
- Use client-side tRPC queries as alternative
- Implement static data rendering if necessary

#### Risk: Styling/Responsive Design Challenges

**Time-Saving Approach:**

- Use existing Tailwind utility classes
- Implement mobile-first, simple grid layout
- Focus on functionality over visual perfection

### Technical Risks

#### Risk: TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Prevention:**

- Maintain strict typing throughout development
- Regular compilation checks during implementation
- Use proper type imports for tRPC procedures

#### Risk: Server Action Implementation Issues

**Backup Plan:**

- Use traditional form submission with API routes
- Implement basic validation without Zod if necessary
- Focus on functional form over advanced error handling
