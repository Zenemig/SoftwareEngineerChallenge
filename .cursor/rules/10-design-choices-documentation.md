# DESIGN_CHOICES.md Documentation Management

## Overview
The DESIGN_CHOICES.md document is the most important deliverable for the take-home assessment. It must be maintained as a living document that evolves incrementally as work progresses, using the DESIGN_CHOICES_TEMPLATE.md as the structural guide.

## Documentation Strategy

### Template-Based Structure
- **Source**: Use DESIGN_CHOICES_TEMPLATE.md as the structural template and question guide
- **Target**: Fill DESIGN_CHOICES.md with actual answers based on completed work only
- **Approach**: Incremental updates that correspond to actual implementation progress

### Incremental Update Process
1. **Work-Driven Updates**: Only document work that has been completed
2. **Section-by-Section**: Update relevant template sections as work is done
3. **Specific Answers**: Replace template questions with concrete answers about our decisions
4. **No Speculation**: Avoid documenting planned work or hypothetical implementations

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Application Architecture Overview
- **Update When**: Architecture decisions are made and implemented
- **Content**: Actual components, data flow, and relationships that exist
- **Avoid**: Planned features or components not yet built

### 2. Key Technical Decisions & Trade-Offs
- **Update When**: Significant technical choices are made during implementation
- **Content**: Real decisions with actual alternatives considered and rationale
- **Structure**: Add subsections for each major technical domain as work progresses

### 3. Future Improvements & Next Steps
- **Update When**: Current phase is complete and next priorities are clear
- **Content**: Specific next steps based on what we've learned from completed work
- **Focus**: Realistic improvements based on actual implementation experience

### 4. Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned
- **Update When**: After overcoming implementation challenges
- **Content**: Real challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- **Value**: Honest reflection on what worked and what didn't

### 5. Implementation Results & Quality Assessment
- **Update When**: Features or systems are complete and functional
- **Content**: Objective assessment of what was built and how well it works
- **Timing**: Self-Assessment subsection reserved for final project completion

## Update Triggers

### Immediate Update Scenarios
- **New Rule Created**: Document rule management decisions
- **Feature Implemented**: Document component architecture and technical choices
- **Challenge Overcome**: Document problem-solving approach and lessons learned
- **Pattern Established**: Document emerging conventions and standards

### Section Update Mapping
```
Work Completed → Document Section to Update
├── Rule System → Development Tooling & Rule Management
├── Gallery Page → Data Fetching Strategy + Component Architecture
├── Like Functionality → State Management + Component Patterns
├── Submission Form → Form Handling & Validation + Server Actions
├── Advanced Features → Advanced Challenge Implementation
└── Project Complete → Self-Assessment
```

## Content Quality Standards

### Answer Characteristics
- **Specific**: Reference actual code, files, and implementation details
- **Reasoned**: Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
- **Honest**: Include challenges, mistakes, and iterations
- **Professional**: Clear, concise, and well-structured

### Avoid These Patterns
- **Future Tense**: "We will implement..." → Focus on completed work
- **Generic Answers**: Template-like responses → Specific to our implementation
- **Speculation**: "This would probably..." → Only document actual decisions
- **Premature Assessment**: Self-assessment before work is complete

## AI Agent Instructions

### When Updating Documentation
1. **Read Current Document**: Understand what's already documented
2. **Identify New Content**: Determine what new work should be documented
3. **Map to Template**: Find appropriate template section for new content
4. **Write Specific Answers**: Replace template questions with concrete answers
5. **Maintain Flow**: Ensure new content integrates well with existing documentation

### Update Process
```
User completes work → AI identifies documentation needs → 
Maps to template section → Writes specific answers → 
Updates DESIGN_CHOICES.md → Confirms accuracy with user
```

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Answers are specific to completed work
- ✅ Template questions are replaced with actual answers
- ✅ Content flows logically within template structure
- ✅ No speculation about unfinished work
- ✅ Self-Assessment section preserved for final completion

## Maintenance Philosophy
- **Living Document**: Evolves with implementation progress
- **Work-Driven**: Content directly corresponds to completed tasks
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to document thoroughly than quickly
- **Template Fidelity**: Maintain template structure while providing specific answers
- **Final Polish**: Reserve comprehensive self-assessment for project completion

## Success Metrics
- Document accurately reflects completed work
- Template structure is maintained and followed
- Answers are specific and detailed
- Self-assessment awaits project completion
- Document serves as comprehensive project record
