# Documentation Requirements

## DESIGN_CHOICES.md Completion
This document is **the most important part** of your submission. Allocate sufficient time to complete it thoroughly.

## Required Documentation Sections

### 1. Application Architecture Overview
Document your high-level architecture decisions:
- How you structured components and data flow
- Server vs Client Component decisions
- Relationship between client and server code
- tRPC integration patterns used

### 2. Key Technical Decisions & Trade-Offs
Explain your most significant decisions:
- **Data Fetching Strategy:** Why tRPC server-side calling?
- **State Management for Likes:** Your approach to client-side state
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Client vs server validation decisions
- **Component Architecture:** How you structured reusable components
- **Type Safety:** Your TypeScript integration approach

### 3. Future Improvements & Next Steps
Document what you would do with more time:
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Search, filtering, pagination
- **Performance Optimizations:** Image loading, caching, bundling
- **Feature Expansions:** Authentication, real-time updates, detailed pages
- **Production Readiness:** Database integration, file uploads, monitoring

### 4. Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned
Be transparent about your development process:
- What was difficult and how you solved it
- Any tRPC, Next.js, or TypeScript challenges
- What you learned during implementation
- What you would do differently

### 5. Implementation Results & Quality Assessment
Self-assess your work:
- **Feature Completeness:** What you completed vs requirements
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Type safety, reusability, error handling
- **Advanced Challenge Implementation:** If attempted, explain your approach
- **Self-Assessment:** What you're proud of and what you'd improve

## Documentation Best Practices
- **Be Specific:** Use concrete examples and code snippets
- **Explain Reasoning:** Don't just describe what, explain why
- **Show Trade-offs:** Acknowledge alternatives you considered
- **Be Honest:** Discuss both successes and challenges
- **Future Focus:** Demonstrate forward thinking

## Time Allocation for Documentation
- **During Development:** Take notes on key decisions
- **Final 30-45 minutes:** Dedicated documentation time
- **Don't Rush:** Quality documentation is part of the assessment

## Template Structure to Follow
The DESIGN_CHOICES.md template provides the exact structure expected. Follow it closely and provide detailed responses to each section.

## What Makes Great Documentation
- **Clarity:** Easy to understand your thought process
- **Depth:** Shows understanding of technical concepts
- **Professionalism:** Well-organized and thoughtfully written
- **Insight:** Demonstrates problem-solving and architectural thinking
